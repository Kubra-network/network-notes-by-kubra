# network-notes-by-kubra
This repository contains my personal network engineering notes collected over two years of hands-on work in R&D, PoCs, customer deployments, and multi-vendor Wi-Fi/switching environments.

I created this repo to keep my notes organized, make them searchable for others, and share practical configurations and concepts I used in real environments.

If you find it helpful or want to follow the updates, you can connect with me on LinkedIn.
