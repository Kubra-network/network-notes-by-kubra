# Network Notes by Kübra 

This repository contains my personal network engineering notes collected over two years of hands-on work in R&D, PoCs, customer deployments, and multi-vendor Wi-Fi environments.

I use this repo to document commands, troubleshooting patterns, and the practical insights I found useful while working in real scenarios.
