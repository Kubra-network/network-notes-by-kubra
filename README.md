# network-notes-by-kubra
A collection of personal notes, field experiences, network fundamentals, Wi-Fi insights, and troubleshooting workflows.

All content is based on my real-world work in R&D, PoCs, customer deployments, wireless optimization, and multi-vendor network engineering.

This repository grows over time as I continue learning, testing, breaking, fixing, and documenting.
