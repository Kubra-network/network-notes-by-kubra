# Flex Profile at Cisco 9800 WLC SSIDs

Flex profile vlans should be the same with policy profile vlans!!!

Site Tag defines if the APs are in Local Mode or Flexconnect mode . Flex profile is part of the site tag.

FlexConnect is a wireless solution that enables customers to configure and control access points(AP)in a branch or remote office from the corporate office through a wide area network  (WAN) link without deploying a controller in each office. 

The FlexConnect access points can switch client data traffic locally and perform client authentication locally when their connection to the controller is lost. When they are connected to the controller, they can also send traffic back to the controller. In the connected mode, the FlexConnect access point can also perform local authentication.
