# Sleeping Client is Cisco version of MAC authentication for SSID 

Clients with guest access that have had successful web authentication are allowed to sleep and wake up without having to go through another authentication process through the login page.

It can be used for foreign-anchor too.

* A sleeping client does not require reauthentication in the following scenario as well :

Suppose there are two controllers in a mobility group. A client that is associated with one controller goes to sleep and then wakes up and gets associated with the other controller .
