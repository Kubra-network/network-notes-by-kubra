# Meraki Data-Carrier Detect (DCD): 

When enabling RADIUS accounting on a sign-on splash page with my RADIUS server, the option Enable data-carrier detect becomes available.

If "data-carrier detect" is enabled, sessions will be revoked and accounted for whenever a client disassociates from a network.

To allow clients to reassociate to the network without reauthorization, do not enable "data-carrier detect."
