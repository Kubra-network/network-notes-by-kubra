# Seamless Wi-Fi Login for Client via MAC Caching on RADIUS Scenerio

MAC caching uses MAC authentication.

MAC authentication config sends the client to the RADIUS server with MAC and RADIUS decides to login or not via MAC caching config.

Seamless connection is all about the RADIUS server. So different vendors, different folders doesn't matter if the SSID name is the same.

On the client device SSID should be auto-join and there should be no other auto join SSID.
